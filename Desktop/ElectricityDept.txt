 Subject: URGENT: Dangerous water levels / ELECTRICITY PANEL BOARD MOVE TO PREVENT FLOODING 

Dear Sir,
I am a resident of 1-10/27/17 Prakashnagar Extension colony. The extension colony was fully flooded and we had water level up to waist height on our street and even inside the gate and our ELECTIC PANEL BOARD MAIN SWITCH was almost at the verge of being under water.
 Request you to please take this as an emergency case and make arrangements to move the board to a higher altitude to prevent it from flooding and short circuit fire.

PLEASE TREAT THIS REQUEST AS URGENT and AN EMERGENCY CASE.

Below are my Address and Meter information.
