Subject: Handling of the IATA response - mockup screens

Hi,

Please find enclosed my proposals for the display of the IATA responses. I updated the same document as the one I created for the new main document mask. I wanted to have all the UI requirement in one consistent document.

Please jump directly to section 2 - Handling IATA response display (page 9)

Review the associated process flow and the screens then give me your feedback.

Thank you very much!
