WEbex
Timesheet
RISKS 
Communication Risks  -offshore, Matrix format working agreement openness to ask questions
Technology - Data Migration/Transformation risks, Dependendency risks on CS, Catalog, Sabre for downstream systems
Sschedule risks: schedule development on sequencing things that be done in parallel. Backlog grooming to include SOAPUI tests on interfaces that were ready. Open SR's for firewalls, SABRE etc and followups.
Resource risks : Shared resource, plan schedule accordingly, add to agenda  meeting invite  or in some cases invite for standup calls.
Standup calls, invite Shared resouces 
Business acceptance: Users sign off on reports, Correctness of data was a big risk.
PO availablity : Plan according to their avaiablity and work with them offline to get answers in formal communication9
Stragetic planning risks: BIG BANG, Segmented approach drain down, Rehersals, helpdesk Command center

Chanllenges of agile:
PO avaialablity
PO unsure and keeps going back and forth on requirements not being firm on requirements
INVEST PRINCIPLES of User stories and Independent factor is challenging as ther are quite a few dependencies 
Developers Mindset , Do not want to document 
Senior management : Openness to enbrace agile and enpowerment of teams culture.

Data Migration/Transformation risks
1. Quality and correctness of data.
2. Data Certification: 100% accurate
3. Data Reconsiliation: Technical Reconsiliation ( Run and target and source systems to verify counts) / Functional Reconsiliation  Run a few business scenerios
4. Compliance requirements: Data retention Online, offline and purge >20 years data.
5. Historical data : Put in DORMANT database and use Union joins if you need it
6. legacy application: No code, no maintaince, Data format is not correct, DATA format issues, null values, mandatory values need transformation
7. Proper Handshake: the upstream systems modified the data without information the downstream systems
8. Actuals v/s expected values: Identify top business/data scenerios and test them, have Beta testing cycles with realtime data.
9.MDM data: master data management . Have one common store for Operation data from the two systems and no duplicates most correct data
10. Segmented approach with 3 drill downs and Rehersals with .vmd file batch file boot order modified to boot up.
